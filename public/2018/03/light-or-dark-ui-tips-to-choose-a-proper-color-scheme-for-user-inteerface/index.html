In both personal and professional life, we have to consider numerous oppositions and challenges, and it’s better when solutions are based on not only suggestions but also facts, experience and knowledge. Today we are going to discuss one <a href="https://www.google.com" class="bio-link -fancy">Google&rsquo;s Homepage</a> of the frequent choices UI designers have to make project by project: which scheme is better for the interface, light or dark?</p><h3 id="hello">Hello</h3><p>Factors Influencing the Choice of Color Scheme Be sure, there is no one particular choice which would work for all the aims. The solution heavily depends on numerous factors covering not only user’s side but also business goals, market conditions, and current design trends. Let’s review the essential factors which have to be considered regarding the issue.</p><ul><li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li><li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li><li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li></ul><ol><li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li><li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li><li>Unordered list can use asterisks</li></ol><blockquote><p>asdas dsadsad asdasdsa dsads asda sdsadsadasd asdsadsads asdasdsad sada sdasdsadsads asdasdsads adasdasd sadsads asdasd sadsada sdasdsadsads ?</p></blockquote><p>Readability and legibility These terms are both directly connected to the perception of content presented with text. Readability defines how easily people can read words, phrases, and blocks of copy. Legibility measures how quickly and intuitively users can distinguish the letters in a particular typeface.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*odG2LJMa7L_5FnRm73w8NA.png" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1"> <em>Great Image</em></p><p>These characteristics should be carefully considered, especially for the interfaces filled with a lot of text. Among many other factors, the color scheme chosen for the interface plays the crucial role in the effective process of text perception. For example, as well as with physical objects perceived on different backgrounds, black copy shown on white or light background seems to be larger than the white copy on a dark background. Poor readability results in poor user experience: users aren’t able to scan the data, even more — even if the data is relevant but not readable, users feel the inexplicable tense struggling with the text or may even miss the critical information.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*odG2LJMa7L_5FnRm73w8NA.png" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p><p>Does it mean that interfaces with light background are more readable? Not always. One of the famous gurus of user experience design Jacob Nielsen mentioned: «Use colors with high contrast between the text and the background. Optimal legibility requires black text on white background (so-called positive text). White text on a black background (negative text) is almost as good. Although the contrast ratio is the same as for positive text, the inverted color scheme throws people off a little and slows their reading slightly. Legibility suffers much more in color schemes that make the text any lighter than pure black, especially if the background is made any darker than pure white.»</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*odG2LJMa7L_5FnRm73w8NA.png" alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1"> <em>Great Image</em></p><h3 id="hohohohoho-hohoho-hoho">Hohohohoho hohoho hoho</h3><p>So, any color scheme may be readable enough if the designer studies the peculiarities of copy perception on different backgrounds and works carefully on the font choice.</p><p>Museu Landing Page However, some scientific studies dating back to 1980s show that for big bulks of text light background appears to be a more effective choice for the majority of users. Studying how advertising carriers worked, D. Bauer and C.R.Cavonius shared their explorations in the paper «Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal» (1980). In particular, they found that participants were 26% more accurate in reading text when it was featured with dark characters on a light background.</p><p>Why may that be so? Jason Harrison from Sensory Perception and Interaction Research Group (University of British Columbia) explains this phenomenon the following way. People with astigmatism (which according to various stats present about 50% of the population) feel it harder to perceive white text on black than black text on white. Part of this has to do with light levels. With a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the «deformed» lens. With a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye. So, based on this, if the interface presents a lot of copy and suggests long-reading experience, a light background may feel more user-friendly.</p></article></section><div class="js-scroll-top-button _dp-n _dp-f-sm _alit-ct _jtfct-ct _cl-white _pst-f _bfvsblt-hd _zid-1 _w-48px _h-48px _bgcl-primary-300 _bgcl-primary-400-hover _r-12px _bt-12px _bdrd-4px _cs-pt _opct-80 u-rise"><i class="far fa-chevron-up _fs-4"></i></div><script>let intervalId=0;const scrollButtonElem=document.querySelector(".js-scroll-top-button");function scrollStep(){0===window.pageYOffset&&clearInterval(intervalId),window.scroll(0,window.pageYOffset-128)}function scrollToTop(){intervalId=setInterval(scrollStep,16.66)}scrollButtonElem.addEventListener("click",scrollToTop);</script><footer class="_dp-f _alit-ct _jtfct-ct _bgcl-primary-00 _pd-16px _cl-primary-300 _fs-7" style="height:var(--footer-height)">chanto.io @ 2018</footer></body></html>
